What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository using git init command, you are creating
a directory that it is going to save all metadata about changes of the files
that you are tracking of. You need to do this because with this you have
the option to choose only the files you want to follow their changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
WWhile using a directory for staging, you can keep working on a project and subsaving different changes, but small changes. When you have enough small changes you can commit your project and have a significant new project.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Because it is better to modify a file when you have enough changes, a logical change could be one of them<
