I am still learning how to use git.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because there could be changes that you are not ready to commit.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
You use a fork when you want to create a copy of a project that you do not have permissions to change it directly.
You use clone when you want to create a copy of your project from remote to local or remote to remote.
You use a branch to work in a project that you have permissions to modify it.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Because we can follow changes from the main project.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I think it's better to use Git or GitHub to collaborate in a software project because you can work in differente stages of your project and when you are done you can merge your part with the rest of your team.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
It is really helpful because you can assign different features of a project to different people, so each one can work on the same project and when they are done they can merge all the features to a single master project.
