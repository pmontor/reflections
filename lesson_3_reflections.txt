I am still learning how to use git.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because there could be changes that you are not ready to commit.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
You use a fork when you want to create a copy of a project that you do not have permissions to change it directly.
You use clone when you want to create a copy of your project from remote to local or remote to remote.
You use a branch to work in a project that you have permissions to modify it.
